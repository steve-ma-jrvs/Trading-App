# Trading App
# Introduction
- Briefly explain what does this project do (e.g. it an online stock trading simulation REST API which can blah..blah) and who can use this API (e.g. front-end developer, mobile developer, and traders can utilize this REST API)
- Briefly talk about technologies used in this project(e.g. It's a MicroService which is implemented with SpringBoot. PSQL database. IEX market data)

# Quick Start
- Prequiresites: Java, Docker, CentOS 7
- PSQL init
- git clone and mvn build
- Start Springboot app using a shell script
  - describe env vars
- How to consume REST API? (Swagger screenshot and postman with OpenAPI Specification, e.g. http://35.231.122.184:5000/v2/api-docs

# REST API Usage
## Swagger
What's swagger (1-2 sentences, you can copy from swagger docs). Why are we using it or who will benefit from it?
## Quote Controller
- High-level description for this controller. Where is market data coming from (IEX) and how did you cache the quote data (PSQL). Briefly talk about data from within your app

- briefly explain the following logic layers or components (3-5 sentences for each)
  - Controller 
  - Service
  - Dao
  - SpringBoot: webservlet/TomCat and IoC
  - PSQL and IEX
